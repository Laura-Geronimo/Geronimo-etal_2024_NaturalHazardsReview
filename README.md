## Abstract
ABSTRACT: 
Coastal impacts from climate-induced sea level rise and storm surge are straining finances at federal, local, and household levels, elevating debates on resource distribution for adaptation. In the U.S., cost-sharing agreements create expectations for federal aid after flood disasters. However, the continued use of federal funds to backstop the cost of disasters may become unsustainable. We focus on the neighborhood of Ortley Beach in the municipality of Toms River, New Jersey, to evaluate the  efficiency and distribution of costs after Superstorm Sandy. Findings demonstrate how intergovernmental transfers soften local budget constraints and incentivize rebuilding. We propose alternative response scenarios and apply a conservative economic analysis to identify the most cost-effective policies over 50 years. Results vary with discount rates and assumptions about home values, protection costs, and residual risk. At a 2 percent discount rate, buyout costs breakeven with the costs of rebuilding and elevating homes if the market value of homes is deflated by approximately 35 percent, or if the residual risk and protection estimates are approximately doubled. Clustered buyouts of the most exposed homes would likely have been optimal post-Sandy. This case study presents methods for evaluating distributional and efficiency outcomes of adaptation pathways relevant to other regions.
